title: Hello Blog!
---

I've started a blog to record the things I am thinking about, working on, and
learning. My interests range between analyzing data and designing robust
 predictive models, contributing to open source software, and interesting
challenges that come out of working at early stage tech startups.

I'll mostly be writing a way to record what I am learning and how I am learning
 it. Writing out what I am thinking in the most detailed way possible has always
 been the best and fastest way for me to learn things. I've been hankering to really dig in to deep learning, specifically autoencoders. Improving my handle on
 Scala is definitely on my TODO list. So, here goes nothing.
